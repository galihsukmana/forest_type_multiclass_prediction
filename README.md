## Introduction
In this project, I developed a supervised learning model to tackle the task of How to classify forest cover types based on the features. The model utilizes Random Forest algorithms and is trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and make accurate predictions. The goal of this project is to predict the types of forest.

## Dataset
The model was trained using a labeled dataset called cov_type.csv. This dataset is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the original source can be found on this link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype. The original database owners are Jock A. Blackard, Dr. Denis J. Dean, and Dr. Charles W. Anderson of the Remote Sensing and GIS Program at Colorado State University.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:galihsukmana/forest_type_multiclass_prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To use the trained model for making predictions, follow these steps:
1. Load the pre-trained model weights
2. Preprocess the input data
3. Make predictions using the model


## Results
This model is the second classification exercise to compare any performa from each algorithms. This model has a 95% accuracy score for prediction

## Contributing
